# Profile System Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the User Profile system in the FGI CRM application. The refactoring focused on improving UI/UX, fixing the Admin profile reload issue, and implementing secure email and password editing through a dedicated Settings page.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Profile Reload Issue ✅
**Problem**: Admin profile was causing page reloads instead of properly loading.
**Root Cause**: The `GetAdminProfileAsync` method was trying to access `LeadAssignmentHistories` without proper error handling.
**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks around the assignments query, allowing the profile to load even if assignments data is unavailable.

### 2. UI/UX Improvements ✅
**Changes Made**:
- Removed direct editing modals from all profile pages
- Replaced "Edit Profile" buttons with "Settings" links
- Maintained clean, dashboard-style layout with clear sections
- Preserved role-based KPIs and recent activity displays
- Improved visual hierarchy and user experience

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Settings Page System ✅
**Location**: `/Settings`
**Purpose**: Centralized location for user account management

#### Components Created:
- **ISettingsService Interface**: Defines contract for settings operations
- **SettingsService**: Business logic for user settings management
- **SettingsController**: Handles settings-related HTTP requests
- **UserSettingsViewModel**: View model for settings page

- Real-time validation and feedback

### 3. Password Editing Security ✅
**Implementation**:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### 2. AJAX Implementation
